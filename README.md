# Project 4 - Unsupervised Machine Learning
 The aim of this project is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to find whether an individual will develop a heart attack risk or not. More specifically, after some feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, the k-means and agglomerative clusteing algorithms will be explored.
